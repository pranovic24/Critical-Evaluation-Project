## Critical-Evaluation-Project
This project focuses on the application and implementation of Random Matrix Theory (RMT) in analyzing and interpreting
the global financial indices during the 2008 financial crisis. Using RMT, it is possible to know the empricial eigenvalue
distribution and its corresponding distribution of the eigenvector components. As a result, comparisons will be made to analyze
the financial data in three different periods which are before, during and after the 2008 financial crisis. Furthermore, new
contributions will be introduced and implemented to analyze, clean and provide an interpretation and comparison of the
financial data from the three different periods of the financial crisis.
